## 1. **R Markdown**

### *1.1 Introduction*

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

### *1.2 Sub Description*

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
print("Hello world")
print("today learnt some syntex of programming language in R Markdown, mainly on formatting R Markdown into pdf")
print("[link] http://google.com/sg; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spr0ZHC2x2o")
```

## 2. **Including Plots**

You can also embed *plots*, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Trying out a bullet point below:
- dash this doesn't turn into a bullet

- change text  
- bullets    
- try 3 spacing   and followed by sth else with no spacing at end
- try 1 spacing only 
- as long as the sentence starts with - and ends with two spacing, it turns into a bullet point, but i'm not sure whether the formatting will change to a second row with front spacing also
